# Adding more functionality to your bot. 

<TOC HERE>

> **IMPORTANT TIP**: <br />
> To activate changes in your bot code, you have to stop the script process (CTRL-C) and *START IT* again. (like in 
[step 3](https://github.com/DJF3/spark_botkit_lab/blob/master/3.md#start-the-bot-code)  

<br />

# 5. Send Formatted messages 

**Question**: How does your bot respond to your message? How do you make the Bots response easier to read?

Example: when you say 'hello' to your bot, you want it to respond with 'howdy' and a list of other bot commands you could use. (note that we have not programmed the bot to use these commands)
It would look like this:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://github.com/DJF3/spark_botkit_lab/raw/master/assets/5.smarter-markdown-before.png" width="400">

**Answer**: Use [markdown](https://developer.ciscospark.com/formatting-messages.html)! 

This it what it can look like. Easy to read, using bold, bullets and '>' to make it look like a quote.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://github.com/DJF3/spark_botkit_lab/raw/master/assets/5.smarter-markdown-after.png" width="400">

This can be done by adding the following line in the ```controller.hears``` section of your code:
```javascript
    bot.reply(message, {markdown: '> **available commands**\r>- hello\r>- hello'} )
```

**Result**:

```javascript
controller.hears('hello','direct_message,direct_mention', function(bot, message) {
    bot.reply(message, 'Howdy!');
    bot.reply(message, {markdown: '> **available commands**\r>- hello\r>- hello'} )
});
```

> **NOTE**: In the markdown text you see a ```\r```. This is a 'return', going to the next line

**Try it!** 
Stop & Start the Node process ([step 3](https://github.com/DJF3/spark_botkit_lab/blob/master/3.md#start-the-bot-code)) and send a 'hello' message to your Bot.

It will respond with 2 messages: the 'howdy' message, followed by the nicely formatted helo info.

> **NOTE**: For older devices/clients that don't support markdown, you can use both the ```text``` and ```markdown``` versions: 

```javascript
    bot.reply(message, {text: 'available commands: hello,hello', 
        markdown: '> **available commands**\r>- hello\r>- hello'} )
```

# 6. Create 'Catch-all'

**Question**: What if your bot received commands it doesn't recognize? You could do 2 things:
1. not respond (not very nice)
2. respond with the available commands (nice)

This can be done by adding the following code _at the end_ of the bot script:

```javascript
controller.on('direct_message,direct_mention', function(bot, message) {
    console.log("—-Unknown command: " + message.text);
    bot.reply(message, {markdown: '> **available commands**\r - hello'} )
});
```

> **NOTE**: in the code above you see that an 'unknown' command is also logged to the console.

**Try it!** 
Stop & Start the Node process ([step 3](https://github.com/DJF3/spark_botkit_lab/blob/master/3.md#start-the-bot-code)) and send an *unknown* command to the bot.

> **NOTE**: In the above example we use ```controller.on``` *without* specifying text like 'hello'. That's what makes the code respond to anything that it hasn't processed so far. Instead you *could* also use ```controller.hears```:

```diff
-   controller.on   (          'direct_message,direct_mention',      
+   controller.hears(['(.*)'], ‘direct_message,direct_mention',
```

# 7. Send Welcome Message

**Question**: If a bot is added to a Space there's a chance people won't notice and don't know what it's for and how to use it. You could do 2 things:
1. do nothing (not very nice)
2. send a welcome message explaining what you can do (nice)

This can be done by adding the following code _at the end_ of the bot script:

```javascript
controller.on('bot_space_join', function(bot, message) {
    bot.reply(message, "I am a bot, type ‘hello’", function(err, newMessage) {
        if (newMessage.roomType == "group") {
            bot.reply(message, "This is a Space. You must @mention me.");
        }
	});
});
```

This code is triggered by a ```Membership/Created``` Webhook. The Botkit framework creates these webhooks when you start your code. 

> **NOTE**: the bot code checks if the new membership was direct (1:1 message) or a space. When it's a space it reminds you to use an "@mention" when sending commands to the bot. Otherwise it just says "type hello".

**Try it!** 
Stop & Start the Node process ([step 3](https://github.com/DJF3/spark_botkit_lab/blob/master/3.md#start-the-bot-code)) and add the bot to a Spark space.

# 8. Send a file

What if your bot wants to send a file? There are 2 options:
1. send file from a URL
2. send a local file

**Send file from URL**:

Add the following code at the end of you script and replace the URL ```http://myserver.com/file.pdf``` with a URL that actually serves a file. This URL has to be accessible from the public internet. Example: ```http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/collaboration-endpoints/spark-room-kit-series/datasheet-c78-738729.pdf``` 

```javascript
controller.hears('file','direct_message,direct_mention', function(bot, message) {
    bot.reply(message, {text: 'Here is your file', 
                       files:['http://myserver.com/file.pdf']} );
});
```


**Send a local file**:
Update the ```./newfile.txt``` with an *existing* file in the same folder as the script.

```javascript
controller.hears('file','direct_message,direct_mention', function(bot, message) {
    var fs = require('fs');
    bot.reply(message, {text: 'Here is your local file', 
                       files:[fs.createReadStream('./newfile.txt')]} );
});
```
