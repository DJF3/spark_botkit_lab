# Making our Bot Smarter

Let's make our bot smarter by adding functionality.

<TOC HERE>


> **IMPORTANT TIP**: <br />
> To activate changes in your bot code, you have to stop the script process (CTRL-C) and *START IT* again. (like in 
[step 3](https://github.com/DJF3/spark_botkit_lab/blob/master/3.md#start-the-bot-code)

# 1. Troubleshoot Bot code

To print data to the terminal console, add the the following line to the ```controller.hears``` section of your code:
```javascript
console.log("MESSAGE from: " + message.original_message.personEmail);
```

**Result**:

```javascript
controller.hears('hello','direct_message,direct_mention', function(bot, message) {
    bot.reply(message, 'Howdy!');
    // Adding the console.log line here:
    console.log("MESSAGE from: " + message.original_message.personEmail);
});
```

**Try it!** 
Stop & Start the Node process ([step 3](https://github.com/DJF3/spark_botkit_lab/blob/master/3.md#start-the-bot-code)) and send a 1:1 message to your Bot.

You will see ```**MESSAGE from: your@email.com``` in the terminal window where your Bot code is running.

# 2. Respond to Spaces Only

Do you want your bot only to reply to *either* **1:1 conversations** *or* **@-mentions** (in spaces)?
In your code, remove ```direct_message,``` text (including the comma!): 

In the ```controller.hears``` section of your code:
```diff
- controller.hears('hello','direct_message,direct_mention', function(bot, message)
+ controller.hears('hello','direct_mention', function(bot, message)
```

**Result**:

```javascript
// Below, 'direct_message,' is removed
controller.hears('hello','direct_mention', function(bot, message) {
    bot.reply(message, 'Howdy!');
    console.log("MESSAGE from: " + message.original_message.personEmail);
});
```

**Try it!** 
Stop & Start the Node process ([step 3](https://github.com/DJF3/spark_botkit_lab/blob/master/3.md#start-the-bot-code)) and send a 1:1 message to your Bot.

You will see that your Bot will _not_ respond.

# 3. Bot Command 'starts with'

If you want the code not to listen to “hello” only, but anything that *starts with* ```hello```:
Add a ``` ^ ``` character before the 'hello' string. 

In the ```controller.hears``` section of your code:
```diff
- controller.hears( 'hello','direct_message,direct_mention', function(bot, message)
+ controller.hears('^hello','direct_message,direct_mention', function(bot, message)
```

**Result**:

```javascript
// Below, 'direct_message,' is removed
controller.hears('^hello','direct_message,direct_mention', function(bot, message) {
    bot.reply(message, 'Howdy!');
    console.log("MESSAGE from: " + message.original_message.personEmail);
});
```

**Try it!** 
Stop & Start the Node process ([step 3](https://github.com/DJF3/spark_botkit_lab/blob/master/3.md#start-the-bot-code)) and send a message to your Bot.

You will see that your Bot not only responds to ```hello```, but also ```hello bot```.

# 4. Respond to people from a specific domain only

If you want your bot *only* to work (respond) for people in a specific domain, add a configuration entry 

1. In the ```var controller = Botkit.sparkbot({``` section, add:
```limit_to_domain: [‘@yourdomain.com’],```

Only have 1 Cisco Spark account?
* Use 'yourdomain.com' and see that the bot will not respond to your message because it's not coming from the 'yourdomain.com' domain.
* *Or* create a new Cisco Spark account with a different email domain (Gmail?) and configure this domain in the ```limit_to_domain``` setting. Now you can test messages from both domains and see that it only responds to one of them. **Tip**: To prevent logging in and out of your Cisco Spark client, use a *browser* to login with your second Cisco Spark account.

**Result**:

```javascript
var controller = Botkit.sparkbot({
    public_address: process.env.public_address,
    ciscospark_access_token: process.env.access_token,
    secret: process.env.secret,
    // the line below makes the bot only listen to users in the 'yourdomain.com' domain
    limit_to_domain: [‘@yourdomain.com’],
});
```

**Try it!** 
Stop & Start the Node process ([step 3](https://github.com/DJF3/spark_botkit_lab/blob/master/3.md#start-the-bot-code)) and using a Cisco Spark user account with a domain different than the one you configured, send a message to your Bot.

Then send a 1:1 message to your bot from a Cisco Spark account that is configured in the 'limit_to_domain' setting.
